Uploading Images
================

Images should be uploaded as a Zip file of JPG images. You'll need to upload any new images that you want to add before you add any metadata. Depending on how many images you add they can take a while to process (hours initially, to be fully indexed and searchable it could take many more hours or days).

The images shouldn't be smaller than about 300 pixels on any side. Ideally they would be much larger. Having them be at least 1000 pixels on each side would be good to start with. It's important to note that the names of the images should match the file names provided in the metadata file.

If you ever upload an image that was previously uploaded then the old image will be replaced with the new one.

If you ever upload any new images you'll also need to upload a new metadata file in order for the new images to be displayed on the site. (Metadata records that have no images associated with them are never added to the database.)
